These are the solutions for the advent of code 2022.

The objective of this year's advent is:
  1. Try out the Advent of Code
  2. Solve all problems using only the terminal.
    a. The folder is only open in Iterm2 terminal
    b. All files are created, accessed and written using nvim.
    c. Files are copied, viewed and renamed using UNIX commands cp, cat, and mv.
  3. If time allows, try out different programming languages.
    a. I would like to try out Javascript, as I will have to get to know it for further projects; Namely react and possibly node.
    b. These solutions would not be written in the terminal, as getting to know the language is enough.
